# APKGrabber
APKGrabber is a fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Big thanks and of course
all credits go to [rumboalla](https://github.com/rumboalla).
I try to develop new features and maintain the software to stay available on latest android devices,
but don't expect weekly updates.

# Roadmap
* [x] Releasing APKUpdater as a new, seperate version APKGrabber to provide fixed APKMirror API break.
* [ ] Updating the build system, as it's full of deprecation warnings.
* [x] Adding enhanced handling for APKMirror.
